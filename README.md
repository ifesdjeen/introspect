# Introspect

Introspect is a Clojure library that helps library builders to track 
input and output values and their types to avoid unnecessary type 
errors.

## Goals

  * track values, include stack of the "untypical" values 
  * allow type-hinting and giving advise on return types and best 
  practices
  * track calling threads, possibly tracking interleaving
